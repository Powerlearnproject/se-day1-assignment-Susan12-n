# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software engeenering is a profession that includes creating solution to real word challanges,through designing software by writing codes, testing codes and fixing bugs

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Development of programming languages including C.
beggining of structured programming  in late 90,s
rise of agile methodologies

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
requirement-first stage of the development cycle and it includes gathering facts about a problem that needs a solution,automation.
design-creating the desired design of the user interface
implementation- Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
deployment-putting the software into action.
maintainance-proving regular support and update

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
waterfall flows downward following all the steps of SDLC,(requirements,design,implementation,deployment,maintainance) while agile follows  itetrative  and incremental approach

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer-writing code and implementing software solutions.
Quality Assurance Engineer-Ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
Project Manager-Oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)- Software suites that provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing code ie,VS code.
Version Control Systems (VCS) -Software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members ie, Git.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
tight timelines and changing requirements.
strategies-effective communications and reqular reassesment.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
unit testing-Testing individual components or  of software.
intergration testing-Testing interactions between different components.
system testing-Testing the entire software system 

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
prompt engineering is about crafting questions to get the best,clear and intended answer from an AI model


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
create for me a Bio.
help me create a Bio,i have a diploma in ict and have taken a certificate in software engeering and always ready to learn in my course i gained skills in wed development using HTML,CSS and python 
The second version is more effective since you have provided clear what the bio should  include and which direction should it take like for this case, IT field.
